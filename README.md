# Poetry Copier

A [copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) template for scaffolding Python packages and apps (FastAPI and Gradio) using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as package 
manager and [Development Containers](https://containers.dev/) as reproducible development environment.

This template is a loose port of the [Radix Poetry Cookiecutter](https://github.com/radix-ai/poetry-cookiecutter) and comes with the same [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## 💻 Demo

Check out the following demos for examples of scaffolded projects using this template:

- FastAPI App with GitHub Actions: [poetry-copier-fastapi-demo](https://github.com/lukin0110/poetry-copier-fastapi-demo)
- Python Package with GitHub Actions: [poetry-copier-package-demo](https://github.com/lukin0110/poetry-copier-package-demo)
- FastAPI App with GitLab CI/CD: [poetry-copier-fastapi-demo-gitlab](https://gitlab.com/lukin0110/poetry-copier-fastapi-demo-gitlab)
- Python Package GitLab CI/CD: [poetry-copier-package-demo-gitlab](https://gitlab.com/lukin0110/poetry-copier-package-demo-gitlab)

- ♻️ Continuous integration with [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) or [GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/)
- 🧰 Dependency updates with [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates) (only with GitHub Actions)
- 🚧 Interactive scaffolding and updates with [Copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

## 🚀 Using

1. Install the latest [copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#installation) in your [Python environment](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) _(please use python>=3.8)_:
    ```bash
    pip install "copier>=9.1.1"
    ```
2. Create a new repository and clone it locally.
3. Run copier in your cloned directory:
    ```bash
    copier copy --vcs-ref=v0.3.0 git@github.com:lukin0110/poetry-copier.git .
    ```

### Updating a project

```bash
copier update --vcs-ref=HEAD --defaults
```
More information on how to update a project and resolve conflicts can be found in the [Copier documentation](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/updating/).   

## 💭 Rationale
This template aims to provide a minimal, but fully functional, project structure for any python project. Focus on what matters: **coding!**  

Setting up a project can be tedious and requires a lot of "plumbing" to get `CI/CD` right, to get `pyproject.toml` right, to get the `Dockerfile` right, etc.

The use of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) in conjunction with [Development Containers](https://containers.dev/) are key in this template to provide a smooth development experience. It's possible to develop without a *Development Container* and use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) with [virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) straight away, however this template is optimized to provide a working development environment with development containers.

> [!Note]
>
> This template is not a good fit if you don't want to work with *Docker* and/or *Development Containers*.

## 🎯 Goals

- Reduce project setup
- Provide [dev/prod parity](https://12factor.net/dev-prod-parity)
- [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) idependent. However, with a strong focus on [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) since it integrates nicely with *GitHub*, *Development Containers* and *GitHub Copilot*
- Provide a minimal workable setup
- Don't enforce application or package architecture
- Include the *usual suspects* of every project: CI/CD, linting, testing, package manager, development container, etc
